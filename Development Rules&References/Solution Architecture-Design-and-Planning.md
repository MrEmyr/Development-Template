# Solution Design and Planning

This document represents the **Solution Design Documentation** and **Solution Planning Document** referenced in `Cursor Setup.drawio`.

## 1. Solution Overview

- **Purpose**: _Describe the problem being solved and the high-level goals._
- **Scope**: _List in-scope and out-of-scope areas for this solution._

## 2. Architecture

- **Draw.io Solution Architecture Diagram**
  - Create and maintain a Draw.io diagram that captures:
    - Main components/services.
    - Data flows and integrations.
    - External systems and APIs.
  - Store the `.drawio` file under `Documentation/` using a relative path.

## 3. Design Decisions

- _Capture key design decisions, alternatives considered, and rationale._

## 4. Solution Planning

- **Roadmap / Iterations**
  - _Outline planned development intervals/sprints._
- **Next Development**
  - _Track the next set of features/tasks; when testing is complete, remove items from this section and reflect them in history/changelog._

## 5. Maintenance Rules

- This document and the architecture diagram **must be created before implementation work**.
- They **must be kept up to date at each development interval**.
