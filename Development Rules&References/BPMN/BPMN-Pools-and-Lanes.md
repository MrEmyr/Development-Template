# BPMN — Pools & Lanes (Reference)

## Pools

- **Pool**
  - **Definition**: A Pool represents a **Participant** in a Process (e.g., a company, external entity, or role).
  - **Common usage**:
    - **White Box Pool**: the primary participant whose internal process flow and activities are shown.
    - **Black Box Pool**: an external participant shown without internal flow/activities (often collapsed).
  - **Collaboration**: Pools (and elements within pools) may be connected using **Message Flows**.

## Lanes

- **Lane**
  - **Definition**: A Lane is a sub-partition of a Pool used to organize work by **participant/role** within the process.
  - **Nesting**: Lanes can be further broken down into **sub-lanes**.
