# Documentation (Solution-Specific)

This folder is intended for **solution-specific development documentation** created as part of implementation (design/planning docs, architecture/UI diagrams, etc.).

- Rules, references, and templates live in `Development Rules&References/`.
- Superseded development docs should be moved into `Documentation/Archive/`, mirroring the active `Documentation/` structure.
