# Documentation Rules

These rules are derived from the `Documentation` notes in `Cursor Setup.drawio`.

## Consolidated Documentation

- **Use a consolidated approach to documentation.**
  - Prefer updating existing core documents instead of creating many small, one-off documents.
  - Keep Solution Design, Solution Planning, and UI documentation as the primary documents.

## Diagrams

- **All diagrams should be created and maintained in Draw.io.**
- Store working Draw.io files in appropriate subfolders under `Documentation/` (for example, architecture diagrams and UI layout diagrams).

## Archive

- Only **archive old files that have been superseded**.
- **Mirror the development folders in `Documentation/Archive/`** so the archive structure matches the active documentation structure.
