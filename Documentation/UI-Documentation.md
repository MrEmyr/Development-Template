# UI Documentation Rules

These rules are derived from the `UI Documentation` notes in `Cursor Setup.drawio`.

## UI Layout

- **Always document a Draw.io UI layout** that can be reviewed.
- Store the UI layout diagram (e.g. `ui-layout.drawio`) under an appropriate subfolder in `Documentation/`.

## Keeping UI Docs Current

- Update the UI layout diagram and any related notes whenever the UI is changed as part of a development interval.
- Use the same consolidated-documentation approach (update core UI docs rather than creating many new ones).
