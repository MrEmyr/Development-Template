# PowerPoint Templates (PPTX/POTX)

This folder contains **PowerPoint-only** documentation and snippets extracted from `.pptx/.potx` files.

- Snippets in `snippets/` are **Open XML (OOXML)** fragments intended for **PowerPoint template work** (Slide Master / Theme).
- Do **not** treat these as web styles (CSS) or general UI tokens; they are specific to PowerPoint’s rendering and file format.
